      <p>It had been stated over the years and by many people that the only things that are certain in life are death and taxes. Our lives are finite. Meaning, that they will eventually end. The biggest fear that I have is living an unfullfilling life. There are things that I want to do, places I want to see and experience, people I want to meet, and experiences that I want to have. Below, I compiled a short list of 10 of the things I would like to do before my eventual solo extinction.</p>

        <header>1. Watch Humpback Whales Bubble-Net Feeding, Close Up and Personal</header>
        <p>One of the biggest reasons why I want to visit the great state of Alaska is because of my love for humpback whales and it is one of only two places on Earth where bubble-net feeding by them can be witnessed. It would be a tremendous joy to hear the whales call and then their giant mouths breaching the water to swallow whole schools of herring.</p>

        <header>2. Visit Several African Countries</header>
        <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Africa is the birthplace of humanity and civilization. It is also the spiritual and ancestral home of all African diasporans living in countries around the world. Therefore, I feel that it is a must that I, being a black American man, a Diaporan, make a pilgrimage to Africa and see as much as i can of the continent before I will not be able to. </p>

        <header>3. SCUBA Dive With Whale Sharks</header>
        <p>Whale sharks are not one of my favorite animals like Humpback Whales and Gorillas are but, I do appreciate their size and grace in the water. I like SCUBA diving and have already done it before. My dream is to dive in a location where whale sharks are so that I can swim close to them.</p>

        <p>My daughter is a digital artist who had created many characters and her own world. I already have three tattoos and plan to get several more. I want to get one of her characters, a zombie named Lizzie, tattooed on me as a sign of my support for my daughter's art. Lizzie is my favorite character that she made. To see more of her art, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/voidhyena/">follow her</a> on Instagram.</p>

        <header>5. Own A Lowrider</header>
        <p>Since I was a teenager, I dreamed of being a part of lowrider culture. I wanted an old school lowrider so badly. A old friend of mine who lived down the street had a Cadillac Coup De Ville with one switch and I loved it. One of these days, I will have my lowrider.</p>

        <header>6. Learn To Speak At Least 2 Other Languages Fluently</header>
        <p>I make it no secret that I love to travel. I've fairly recently got the bug for international travel. Traveling to different countries means that I need to be able to understand and perhaps have some simple conversations in the native language being spoken. Plus, I think that it is really cool when a person speaks more than one language fluently. I would love to visit a country and speak without the aid of some tranlator app or wow my friends by speaking in a foreign language.</p>

        <header>7. Go On A Gorilla Tour</header>
        <p>There is a thrill of walking into a jungle and seeing huge mature male gorillas up close and personal without thick, bullet proof, Chinese takeout restaurant glass seperating you from the extremely large primates as there is in zoos across the country. Sure, this glass is needed to shield disrespectful Western onlookers away from the ire of angry gorillas, who live captivity, slinging fecal matter or attempting to rip an arm out of a socket. But, the glass is NOT necessary when trekking through their territory relatively respectfully.</p>

        <header>8. Become A Member Of Kappa Alpha Psi</header>
        <p>One of the things that separates predominately black greek letter organizations (BGLOs) from predominately white fraternities and sororities is that membership is usually for life and that it is fairly common for people to join <em><b>after</b></em> graduating from college. It had been my dream since being a junior in high school to pledge Kappa Alpha Psi but the fraternity's chapter at the school I attended directly after highschool was suspended. I thought about pledging the local chapter at the time but personal issues affected my grades and my attendance. All of these years, the dream is still there. Although being a member will not give me the social capital that it may had given me when I was much younger and I am probably too old to step and stroll, I really do appreciate the brotherhood, community service, and connections that membership can still provide.</p>

        <header>9. Go Skydiving</header>
        <p>Yes, this is a staple of bucket lists in "First World" nations. The thrill of free-falling towards Earth and cheating with death is very popular. But, it is popular for a reason. People who have already done it report feeling weightless after the initial butterflies associated with the g-forces of falling.</p>

        <p>Many of you already know this but being divorced sucks and dating as a mature adult is as much fun as having a root canal. It is my dream to be a husband again and be with the same woman for the rest of my natural life.</p>
